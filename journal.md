# stuff i learned on the way
- nextjs middleware
- add a client component inside a server managed context provider
- using different env files with "dotenv cli"
- improving in git commit messages
- functional peogramming: object destructuring from setup function with config parameter (js objects can be async functions)
- shared implementation apis (js library export a function that gets called like outsourcing implementation. e.g. GET and POST habdler in spi route as catch all segments)
- not everything needs to be a button. (e.g. signup link in signin form)
- expose auth api, so external can login and use api without ui
- jwe = JSON Web Encryption = user information encrypted inside a cookie. server has the private key to extract. therfore managed by the client (server doesnt store info), verified by the server
